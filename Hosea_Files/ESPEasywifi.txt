Make sure you understand where the problem is, then you can do a basic configuration from the CLI by giving these commands:

    wifiscan (scans for SSID of nearby access points and returns the RSSI, -40 is a strong signal, -80 a weak one)
    wifissid (tells ESPEasy which SSID to use)
    wifikey (tells ESPEasy which WPA key to use)
    wificonnect (connects to the wifi networks)
    save (saves the parameters to flash)
    settings (shows some basic parameters such as IP address and SSID/key)

wifiscan 
wifissid GODMACHINE8454
wifikey dogman778
wificonnect 
save 
settings
